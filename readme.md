lazznav is a funny form ("fufo").

Right clicking naveA or naveB blocks ... opens the Naval Battle fufo.

Sam and his world do not make part of the fun, but without them, there were no funny forms.

So I guess lazznav can´t be called a mod.

The fufo is a pastime, maybe like solitaire, freecell, etc., and may or not be a game.
