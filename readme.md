:relaxed: Tested in Minetest 5.0.1

lazzanim is a funny form ("fufo") that creates an animated image of emojis.

This animated gif created with Gif Construction Set is similar that what we get in formspec!!!

A right-click in the emoji block starts the demonstration.

For small formspecs I think it is a good idea to use minetest.after for obtaining animations!
